# 1_led_blink_simple_rtos
Project: Building an application and blinking 3 LED. Involves configuring GPIO, and freeRTOS to blink a simple LED using my own peripheral library

Main purpose of this project is to learn how to integrate freeRTOS into STM32 and use LL library rather than HAL wherever possible to increase efficiency with STM32 MCUs
